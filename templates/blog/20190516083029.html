<h2> How to create your own blog top page </ h2>

For blogs created with the new_blog command, the top page containing articles for one week is automatically generated. I will explain how to make the top page of the blog a static HTML page.

<h3> Open build script </ h3>

First of all, open the Perl script that is building your site.

<pre>
lib / Giblog / Command / build.pm
</ pre>

<h3> Comment out the process of automatically generating the top page </ h3>

Look for the following code.

<pre>
  #Create index page
  $ self-> create_index;
</ pre>

Comment out this part. Perl comments are "#".

<pre>
  #Create index page
  # $ self-> create_index;
</ pre>

<h3> Place the HTML of the top page </ h3>

Finally, create your own top page. Create the following file.

<pre>
templates / index.html
</ pre>

The content is the content of the top page.

<pre>
<h2> My site </ h2>

This is my site.
</ pre>
